        <h2>Origin of the Dowry System </h2>
        <p>In India, Dowry system that has been prevailing amongst every society and affected lives of the people who are involved in marriage and on those who are around.
            When Princesses of a dynasty got married, the King offered, out of overwhelming joy, a part of his wealth and his State to his Sons-in-Law in a grand wedding function. His Ministers also followed this regal practice as a protocol. The public in general, irrespective of rich and poor, followed this showy practice to maintain 'prestige' and felt great at par with the still rich society.
            This dubious matrimonial tradition however, seeped into the homes of the poor and downtrodden people to muster a false respect.</p>

                    <h3>Initiates gender imbalance:</h3>
                    <ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The society judges the worth of a person on the basis of dowry accepted or received and this framework can be attributed to the detrimental status of woman in the society.</li>

            <h3>Deteriorating financial status of bride’s family:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dowry doesn’t affect the bride alone. Rather, its ordeal extends to bride’s parents and they have to bear the financial demands of their counterparts to ensure well-being of their child.</li>
                <li>With regular demands from the groom’s family, reports of suicides are yet again common in the country. Needless to say, this social evil should necessarily be eradicated for the society and the nation.</li>

           <h3>Economic Effect:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Women aren’t granted equal rights and opportunities, leading to loss of economic workforce. Women are active participants in the development of the nation, and if their rights are hampered at the domestic level, it affects our economic build-up significantly. We lose the consistent workforce at the hands of a social evil and hamper the growth of our own home and the society.</li>

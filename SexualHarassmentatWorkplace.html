                <h3>Scenario 1:</h3>
    <p class="scnarios">Kamini is a bright young team leader working in a call centre. 
                Kamini stays back at work late one evening with her colleague Ravi to complete work for an
              important presentation. Ravi offers to buy Kamini dinner and later drop her home since it’s been
            a long day. After dinner, Ravi proposes to Kamini that he would like her to spend the night with
          him. Kamini refuses politely but firmly and goes home. Next evening, Ravi repeats his request and
           on Kamini’s refusal, threatens her that <b> if she doesn’t give-in </b>, he will tell everyone that she made a
           pass at him.</p>

                <h3>Scenario 2:</h3>
    <p class="scnarios">Jayanthi works in a garment factory in Bangalore.
                        Varghese, Jayanthi’s supervisor, often tries to touch her on one or
                        the other pretext. For example, he adjusts her dupatta while she
                        is sewing at her workstation on the pretext of covering her back.
                        Jayanthi is very uncomfortable with his behaviour. Her colleagues
                        at the workplace ridicule Jayanthi and mock her for the ‘special
                        treatment’ by her supervisor. They often gossip about her and
                        Varghese.

            <ul>
              <li>In scenario 1, Ravi’s threat to Kamini that if she does not agree to his ‘request’ for a sexual
                  favour,<br> he will in return smear her character at the workplace as a person who wants to use sexual favours<br>
                  to her advantage constitutes quid pro quo (this for that) form of sexual harassment.  </li>
              <li>In the second scenario, the physical touching by Varghese is
                  unwelcome and sexual in nature.<br> The gossip, which is based on
                  Varghese’s behaviour towards Jayanthi at the workplace, <br>is creating a hostile work environment
                  for Jayanthi.</li>

             <h2>What is the best way to report sexual harassment?</h2>    
                <p> In most cases, where sexual harassment is proved, employers may terminate the employment of a harasser<br> but eventually they may terminate the employment of the complainant as well as she is perceived as a "troublemaker",<br> not the recipient of trouble. These are genuine fears that overwhelm a woman but unfortunately, it is the reality of<br> corporate India.</p>
            </div>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Consult a lawyer who can give you clarity on the best course of action because facts pertaining to <br> unwelcome conduct would have to be bought within the purview of the law to satisfy the <br> tests for establishing sexual harassment.</li>
                    
                <li>Maintain a record of phone calls, web chats, SMS/MMS, emails or any other communication that<br> will help to establish the factum of harassment. Put down your grievances(s) in writing or<br> electronic form and report it to the Human Resources Department.</li>
                    
                    <li>As stated above, <b>"unwelcome"</b> conduct is an essential requirement for sexual harassment. <br>Firmly refuse any offers of dinners, parties, drinks or other forms of socialization which are not work related.<br> Most importantly, speak to your colleagues about your experiences with the harasser because<br> chances are that you are not the sole victim of the harassment.</li>

    <h1>Domestic Violence</h1>
    <div class="container">
    <div class="blogpost">
        <p>Within the four walls of homes, the violence against women is quite high. Domestic violence against women is widely prevalent, but has remained largely invisible. Statistics reveal that 45% of Indian women are slapped, kicked or beaten by their husbands. (ICRW 2002) .32% had committed acts of violence against their pregnant wives. Every 60 minutes a woman dies in India due to domestic violence. Women accept violence because social norms sanction them. At the same time, cultural conditioning and economic dependence prevent the vast majority of women leaving their marital homes. Though there is criminal law to prevent domestic violence, the recent civil law <b>“Protection of women from Domestic Violence Act (October 2006)”</b> is aimed at providing relief, compensation and support to a woman.</p>

        <strong>Tip: </strong>If you are facing domestic abuse, <strong>DON'T seek to take "revenge"</strong> on those who are trying to harm you. 
        <br>
        It is a futile and endless journey and will leave you and your loved ones much worse off than <br> if you just pick up your things, leave 
         and focus on building a new life for you and your children. 
            <strong><blockquote><cite>The best revenge is to build a successful life without your abuser.</cite></blockquote></strong>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Remember the Government has  enacted <strong>Domestic Violence Act</strong>, which is civil law meant primarily for protection<br> orders and not meant to penalize criminally.</li>     
        </ul>
